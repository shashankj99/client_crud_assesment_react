## Introduction
---
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). It contains three main features:
- Listing clients
- Creating clients
- Getting client detail.

External packages that have been used in this project are:
- react-bootstrap
- bootstrap v5
- react-router
- react-router-dom

## Things to know
---
Since, this was a minor project so no any state management tools (redux, context-api, etc) were used. You'll find the default state management & hooks provided by react.

## Deployment
---
This repo has been deployed to heroku. The link to the live site is [https://client-crud-assessment-react.herokuapp.com/](https://client-crud-assessment-react.herokuapp.com/).

- There are many ways to deply to the heroku. I chose the easiest way, i.e. connect my git repo to the server.
- I then created a Procfile that contains commands to start my app.
